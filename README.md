A TI-83/84 BASIC text-based calculator game I made in middle school. You could travel around from city to city, buy or sell items at varying prices to make money, deposit money in the bank to earn interest, take out loans with an interest rate, etc.

I don't remember the formatting being quite this bad but I literally typed it all on a calculator.
